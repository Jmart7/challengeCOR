# challengeCOR

I wasn't able to solve the challenge but there is a function from a Library i used back in Algorithms Subject which solves the problem exactly.

The source is https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/_modules/networkx/algorithms/euler.html#eulerian_circuit

To install it you just need to do:

`pip install networkx[default]`

The complexity is O(n) where n is the amount of words (The algorithm itself describes as linear time algorithm).
